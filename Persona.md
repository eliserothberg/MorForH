Bob is a 28-year-old paralegal who lives in Cheviot HIlls, a ten minute walk from Palm Station,  and works in DTLA. His concern is primarily quality-of-life as he finds driving in LA traffic stressful.


### Rider 2

Ann is a 35-year-old hair stylist who lives in Hollywood, a fifteen minute walk from Hollywood and Vine Station, and she works in Santa Monica. Her concern is primarily financial, as it’s expensive to park in Santa Monica and her employer doesn’t provide parking. The nearest reliable, affordable parking lot near her is $7 a day and a five minute walk from the salon.
